## Focus Group

### Alexandra

Alexandra is a college student who is already working two jobs just to afford school. To get around the city she takes public transportation because it is more affordable, which is how she came across the advertisement from BusMall. They mentioned a small focus group, aimed at people who take public transit because that will be their intended target audience. Alexandra noted that the focus study should take only 10-15 minutes, which is about all the time she has to spare in her day, so she wants to be sure that the study is what they say it will be. In order to be sure that there aren't additional string attached, Alexandra plans to take a critical eye to the survey program they will be sending her, only being willing to go through with it if it's simple, easy, and fast.
